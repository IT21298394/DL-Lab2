-	What happens when the number of hidden nodes increases?
When we increase the number of hidden nodes, the modelâ€™s learning capacity to learn complex patterns also increases.
This improves accuracy of the prediction. Adding more hidden nodes after a certain point may give overfitting results.
-	Can you explain the pattern of accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
When more hidden nodes are added pattern of accuracy will improve and increase.
Because of model can identify and monitor more complex relationships in the data.
Adding more hidden nodes after a certain point may cause decreases in accuracy.
